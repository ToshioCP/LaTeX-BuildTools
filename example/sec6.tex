\section{Insert and renumber files}

If you want to put a new sec file between sec1 and sec2, create a file
with any number between 1 and 2. For example, name the file ``sec1.5''.
You can leave it as it is, but if you want to change the file numbers to
1,2,3,4 \ldots, use the renumber command.

\begin{verbatim}
$ renumber
\end{verbatim}

This makes:

\begin{verbatim}
sec1.tex => sec1.tex
sec1.5.tex => sec2.tex
sec2.tex => sec3.tex
\end{verbatim}
