\section{Install and uninstall}

You need ruby and tex environment. Ruby 2.7 is
used to develop Buildtools, but it may work even if the ruby version is
2.0 or later. Texlive is recommended for the tex
environment.

The TeX engine is lualatex. If you want to use another engine, Modify
Rakefile. Only a small modification is enough.

Linux was the OS to develop Buildtools, but I think that it will also
work on Windows.

To install, tyoe as follows for Linux

\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo ruby ​​install.rb
\end{verbatim}

The executable file is set in /usr/local/bin and the library
(lib\_latex\_utils) is set in \$LOAD\_PATH{[}0{]}. The variable
\$LOAD\_PATH{[}0{]} points /usr/local/lib/site\_ruby/2.7.0 etc usually.
But it depends on the system. If you have used rbenv to install ruby,
the library destination is under the .rbenv directory of your home
directory.

At the time of installation, newtex and arch\_tex are rewritten.

Uninstall:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo ruby ​​install.rb-
\end{verbatim}
