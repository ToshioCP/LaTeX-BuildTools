\section{Archive}

The document can be archived after you finish your work.

\begin{verbatim}
$ arch_tex -b
\end{verbatim}

This will archive all documents and Rakefile, lib\_latex\_utils.rb,
converter.rb into a bzip2 file. At this time, readme.md, which is a
brief explanation file, is also included. People who get the archive do
not need Buildtools. All they need is a program to unzip the archive and
ruby environment.

You can choose a compression converter by giving an option to arch\_tex.
Three compression types are supprted.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  -b: bzip2
\item
  -g: gzip
\item
  -z: zip
\end{itemize}
