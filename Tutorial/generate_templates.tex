\subsection{newtex.conf}
The script `newtex' makes a directory and generates template files in it.
This is used at the beginning of the work.

First, a configuration file `newtex.conf' needs to be made.
There is a template file included in the Buildtools source files.
\begin{verbatim}
# This is a configuration file for newtex.
# The name of this file is newtex.conf
# A string between # and new line is a commnet and it is ignored
 by newtex.
# Empty line is also ignored. 

title="Tutorial"
# document name

# lb.conf
# Lb.conf has six lines.
# The following six lines are copied to lb.conf.
rootfile=main.tex
builddir=_build
engine=pdflatex
latex_option=-halt-on-error
dvipdf=
preview=evince

# documentclass
documentclass=article

# chapters/sections and subfile names
#   Chapters/sections and subfile names must be surrounded by
 double quotes.
#   Subfile names have no suffix or ".tex" suffix.
# If your LaTeX file is not big and no subfile is necessary, then
 leave out the following lines.
section="Installation" "installation"
section="Run lb to compile tex files" "lb"
section="Generate templates" "generate_templates"   # Subfiles
 are NOT allowed to include space characters. Use underscore
 instead of space. 
section="Edit tex files" "edit_tex_files"
section="Test compile" "test_compile"
section="Preprocessing" "preprocessing"
section="Use rake" "rake"
\end{verbatim}
It is a good way to modify this file to fit your work.

In this tutorial, I want to show you how to make this tutorial pdf file with Buildtools.
The file above is exactly the same as the newtex.conf file as I used to make it.

A string after hash mark (\#) in a line is comment and it is ignored by newtex.
Empty lines are also ignored.
The remaining lines are instructions to newtex.
Each line has a `key=value' structure.
The keys are:
\begin{description}
\item[title] The title of the document you make.
\item[rootfile] The name of the rootfile.
\item[builddir] The name of the build directory
\item[engine] A latex engine to compile source files
\item[latex\_option] The options you want to give to the latex engine
\item[dvipdf] A program that converts dvi to pdf.
\item[preview] A pdf viewer
\item[documentclass] The name of the documentclass you want to use
\item[chapter] Chapters and corresponding subfiles
\item[section] Sections and corresponding subfiles
\end{description}
If you make a book (big document) and use book documentclass, use `chapter' and `section' key.
If you make an article (small document) and use article documentclass, use `section' key only.

\subsection{Run newtex}
After you finish editing newtex.conf, just type:
\begin{verbatim}
$ newtex
\end{verbatim}
Then, newtex makes a directory of which the name is `Tutorial', which is the same as the title in newtex.conf.
If the title includes space characters, they are converted to underscore.
For example, a title `A tutorial for beginners' is converted to `A\_tutorial\_for\_beginners'.
This is because a file name includes space character sometimes causes problems.
Newtex also generates temlate files under the directory.
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd Tutorial
$ ls
Makefile            generate_templates.tex  main.tex
Rakefile            helper.tex              preprocessing.tex
cover.tex           installation.tex        rake.tex
edit_tex_files.tex  lb.conf                 test_compile.tex
gecko.png           lb.tex
\end{verbatim}

Look at some important files.
\begin{verbatim}
$ cat lb.conf
rootfile=main
builddir=_build
engine=pdflatex
latex_option=-halt-on-error
dvipdf=
preview=evince
\end{verbatim}
The contents of this file is the copy of the part of newtex.conf.
\begin{verbatim}
$ cat main.tex
\documentclass{article}
\input{helper.tex}
\title{Tutorial}
\author{} % Write your name if necessary.
\begin{document}
\maketitle
% If you want a table of contents here, uncomment the following
 line.
%\tableofcontents

\section{Installation}
  \input{installation.tex}
\section{Run lb to compile tex files}
  \input{lb.tex}
\section{Generate templates}
  \input{generate_templates.tex}
\section{Edit tex files}
  \input{edit_tex_files.tex}
\section{Test compile}
  \input{test_compile.tex}
\section{Preprocessing}
  \input{preprocessing.tex}
\section{Use rake}
  \input{rake.tex}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
The first line specifies a documentclass which is the same as the value of documentclass key in newtex.conf.
The second line has an input command which includes `helper.tex'.
Helper.tex has a role to include packages with \verb|\usepackage| command, define macros with \verb|\newcommand| command and so on.
Most of the lines in the preamble are described in helper.tex.
It is a good idea to make your own helper.tex because users often use the same preamble in different documents.
If you have your helper.tex, copy and overwrite this file.

You need to edit the fourth line.
For example,
\begin{verbatim}
\author{Toshio Sekiya}
\end{verbatim}
You can add `{\textbackslash}date', `{\textbackslash}thanks', `{\textbackslash}begin\{abstract\}' and `{\textbackslash}end\{abstract\}' if you like.
If you want to make a table of contents, then uncomment the eighth line.
After that, the lines are sections and {\textbackslash}input commands to include subfiles.

Rakefile contains instructions to rake.
You don't need to modify it so far.
Try to use it.
\begin{verbatim}
$ rake
 ... ...
 ... ...
$ ls
Makefile            gecko.png               main.tex
Rakefile            generate_templates.tex  preprocessing.tex
Tutorial.pdf        helper.tex              rake.tex
_build              installation.tex        test_compile.tex
cover.tex           lb.conf
edit_tex_files.tex  lb.tex
$ ls _build
main.aux  main.fdb_latexmk  main.fls  main.log  main.out  main.pdf
$ evince Tutorial.pdf
\end{verbatim}
Rake ran lb to compile main.tex and after that it copied \_build/main.pdf to Tutorial.pdf.
Evince shows Tutorial.pdf as follows.
