Sometimes, you want to do something before compiling your tex source files.
For example,
\begin{itemize}
\item Some graphic files are generated with a program like gnuplot.
\item Some tex files are generated with a program like pandoc.
\end{itemize}

Here in this tutorial I want to show you how to use pandoc as a preprocessing program.
Pandoc is a document converter.
It supports many types of format like markdown, latex, html and pdf.
In this tutorial, `Readme.md' in the Buildtools source files is converted to `readme.tex', which is a latex source file.

Most distributions have a pandoc package, so you can install it easily.
If your distribution is ubuntu, type
\begin{verbatim}
$ sudo apt-get install pandoc
\end{verbatim}

To generate `readme.tex', type
\begin{verbatim}
$ pandoc -o readme.tex ../Readme.md
\end{verbatim}

You need to do two more things.
One is changing main.tex and the other is changing helper.tex

First, add {\textbackslash}input command to include readme.tex at the end of main.tex.
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\input{helper.tex}
 ... ...
 ... ...
\section{Make tarball}
  \input{tarball.tex}
\input{readme.tex}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
In addition, uncommnet the eighth line to let {\textbackslash}tableofcontents command to work.
\begin{verbatim}
 ... ...
\maketitle
% If you want a table of contents here, uncomment the following
 line.
\tableofcontents
 ... ...
\end{verbatim}

Second, {\textbackslash}tightlist command needs to be defined.
Helper.tex is the best place to define it.
\begin{verbatim}
 ... ...
 ... ...
\providecommand{\tightlist}{%
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}}
 ... ...
 ... ...
\end{verbatim}
This code is extracted from \url{https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.latex}.

Now you can compile it with rake.
\begin{verbatim}
$ rake
\end{verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{tableofcontents.png}
\end{center}

Now the contents of `Readme.md' appears as the section nine in the table of contents.

We ran pandoc by hand in this section.
If Readme.md is upgraded, we need to run pandoc again.
It is a tiresome work and it should be done automatically.
One good way is modify Rakefile so that rake does the preprocessing work automatically before compiling.
It will be shown in the next section.
